Codes for paper "Overlapping Community Detection in Complex Networks using Symmetric Binary Matrix Factorization" by Zhong-Yuan Zhang, Yong Wang, and Yong-Yeol Ahn.

To run the tests, just load the files and run demo1.m in Matlab.

All codes are tested under Matlab Version 7.10.0.499 (R2010a), 64bit.

Feedback is very welcome. If you have found a bug, or have any problems or
